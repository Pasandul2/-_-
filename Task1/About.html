                <h4><span>Hey there! I'm Pamith Pasandul,</span> an Entry-Level Software Engineer excited about diving into the tech world. I recently wrapped up my Bachelor's in Software Engineering at NIBM, where I honed my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, and backend tech like PHP, SQL, and NoSQL. I've also got experience with Java, Python, and C++.
                    What really gets me going is solving problems and working in teams. I've worked on cool projects like FARM2MARKET, Liquor Lounge, and Grab & Drive, showcasing my knack for learning new stuff and thriving in fast-paced environments.</h4>
